# 🧙‍♂️ SpartyGnome: A 2D Side-Scrolling Adventure Game

**SpartyGnome** is a 2D side-scroller game developed in C++ using the wxWidgets framework. The game features level loading from XML files, interactive gameplay mechanics, power-ups, and dynamic enemies.

This project was developed as part of a university coursework assignment to explore game engine architecture, object-oriented design, and real-time rendering using a C++ GUI framework.
